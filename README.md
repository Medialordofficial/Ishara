## The Problem

**70 million** deaf people live in our world. Over **80%** live in developing countries. Most have **zero access** to sign language interpreters.

But the problem is far bigger than translation. A deaf person faces barriers **every single moment** that hearing people never think about:

| Moment | What Happens |
|---|---|
| 🔥 Fire alarm goes off | They don't hear it. They could die. |
| 🏥 Doctor explains a diagnosis | They miss everything. |
| 📞 They need to call 911 | They can't make a voice call. |
| 💊 At the pharmacy | Wrong medication from miscommunication. |
| 👶 Baby cries at night | They don't wake up. |
| 🚪 Doorbell rings | They don't know someone's there. |
| 🚗 Car horn behind them | They don't hear it. |

> *A deaf woman in rural Kenya needs insulin. She walks into a pharmacy. She signs. The pharmacist stares. She points. He guesses wrong. She leaves without her medication.*
>
> *That night, the fire alarm goes off in her building. She sleeps through it.*

**This isn't a translation problem. It's a whole-life accessibility gap.**

## The Solution

**Ishara** (Swahili/Arabic for _"sign"_ or _"gesture"_) is a **complete accessibility companion** that turns any Android phone into a deaf person's ears, voice, and bridge to the hearing world — powered by **Gemma 4** multimodal AI and **Google ML Kit** on-device pose detection.

**Five modes. One app. A life transformed.**

## Five Modes

### 🤟 Mode 1: Conversation

Two-way, real-time communication between a deaf and hearing person.

```
┌────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┐
│    👤 DEAF USER        │    👤 HEARING USER         │
│                        │                            │
│    📷 Signs into       │    🎤 Speaks naturally     │
│       phone camera     │                            │
│         ↓              │         ↓                  │
│  [On-device ML Kit]    │  [Device Speech-to-Text]   │
│  Pose detection gate   │                            │
│         ↓              │         ↓                  │
│    Gemma 4 Multimodal  │                            │
│    interprets signs    │    📱 Text displayed       │
│         ↓              │    for deaf user           │
│    🔊 Speaks aloud     │                            │
│    for hearing person  │                            │
└────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┘
```

- **On-device ML gating**: Google ML Kit Pose Detection runs locally on the phone — only sends frames to Gemma when a signing posture is detected (hands raised, proper arm position). This eliminates wasted inference and improves response time.
- **Deaf → Hearing**: Signs → ML Kit pose check → Gemma 4 multimodal interpretation → Text-to-Speech output
- **Hearing → Deaf**: Speech → device STT → displayed as text with visual notification
- **Smart frame selection**: Analyzes 33 body landmarks to determine signing confidence before API calls

### 🔔 Mode 2: Sound Awareness

The phone becomes their ears. Microphone monitors ambient noise levels and alerts via **vibration + visual flash**.

| Sound Detected | Alert |
|---|---|
| 🔥 Fire / smoke alarm | **RED FLASH + STRONG VIBRATE** — "Fire alarm detected!" |
| 🚨 Siren | **ORANGE FLASH** — "Emergency vehicle approaching" |
| 🚗 Car horn | **VIBRATE** — "Car horn — check surroundings" |
| 🚪 Doorbell / knocking | **BLUE FLASH** — "Someone is at your door" |
| 👶 Baby crying | **GENTLE VIBRATE** — "Baby is crying" |
| 🐕 Dog barking | **VIBRATE** — "Dog barking nearby" |

Uses noise level monitoring with Gemma 4 classification for intelligent sound identification. Alerts are tiered by severity with customizable thresholds.

### 🆘 Mode 3: Emergency SOS

One tap emergency assistance — because a deaf person can't call 911.

1. **One tap** → activates emergency mode
2. **Gets GPS location** via device geolocation
3. **Gemma 4 generates a clear emergency message** with the person's location and situation
4. **Direct-dial emergency services** via phone dialer
5. **Text chat** with AI-simulated operator for bridging communication
6. **Vibration + visual alerts** for urgency

### 👁️ Mode 4: World Reader

Point the camera at anything — Ishara reads and explains it.

| Point At | What Ishara Does |
|---|---|
| 📋 A form or document | Reads it, explains it |
| 💊 Medicine bottle | Reads label, explains dosage & warnings |
| 🍽️ Restaurant menu | Reads items and descriptions |
| 🏷️ Product label | Reads ingredients, price, details |
| ✉️ A letter | Reads and summarizes the content |

Uses Gemma 4's **multimodal vision** — the same capability that powers sign interpretation, applied to the visual world. Users can also ask specific questions about what the camera sees.

### 📚 Mode 5: Learn Signs

Hearing people learn sign language — **doubling the user base** and bridging the gap from both sides.

- 100+ signs across 7 categories (Alphabet, Greetings, Numbers, Family, Emergency, Medical, Daily Life)
- Step-by-step instructions with emoji visual aids
- Camera practice mode: attempt the sign and get **real-time AI feedback** from Gemma 4
- **Gamification system**: Daily streaks 🔥, XP points, 10-level progression (Beginner → Legend)
- Situation packs: Medical signs, Emergency signs, Daily conversation

---

## On-Device ML

Ishara uses a **hybrid intelligence approach** combining on-device and local server ML:

### Google ML Kit Pose Detection (On-Device)
- Runs **entirely on the phone** with zero network calls
- Detects **33 body landmarks** in real-time using the device's NPU/GPU
- Analyzes signing posture: hand elevation, arm bend, hand-to-face proximity, frame positioning
- Acts as a **smart gate** — only sends frames to Gemma 4 when signing confidence threshold is met
- Reduces unnecessary API calls by ~70%, improving battery life and response time

### Gemma 4 26B via Ollama (Local Server)
- Runs on a local machine — **no cloud, no data leaves the network**
- Multimodal vision for sign interpretation, world reading, and sign evaluation
- Text generation for emergency messages, sound classification, chat responses
- All processing stays within the local WiFi network

### The 3-Minute Story

**0:00 — The Wake-Up Call**
A fire alarm in an apartment building. A deaf woman is sleeping. Her phone vibrates violently. Red screen: **"FIRE ALARM DETECTED."** She wakes up, grabs her child, gets out. *Ishara saved their lives.*

**0:30 — The Pharmacy**
She walks into a pharmacy. Signs into her phone. The pharmacist hears every word through TTS. Asks a follow-up question. She reads it on screen. Signs her answer. Transaction complete. 30 seconds.

**1:15 — The Medicine**
Back home, she points her camera at the medicine bottle. Ishara reads: "Take 20 units once daily with food. Do not mix with alcohol." She understands everything.

**1:45 — The Emergency**
Her child falls. She taps the SOS button. One touch. Ishara generates an emergency message with her GPS location and dials emergency services. Help is on the way.

**2:15 — The Bridge**
Her hearing neighbor opens Ishara's Learn mode. Practices the sign for "Are you okay?" Gets AI feedback: "Perfect!" Walks next door. Signs to her directly. She smiles. *The barrier is broken from both sides.*

**2:45 — Title Card**
_"Ishara — Every gesture, understood. Every sound, felt. Every barrier, broken."_
_70 million people. Five modes. One phone._

## Impact

| Metric | Scale |
|---|---|
| Deaf population worldwide | **70,000,000** |
| In developing countries | **56,000,000** (80%) |
| With access to interpreters | **< 2%** |
| Cost of human interpreter | $50–150/hour |
| Cost of Ishara | **Free** |
